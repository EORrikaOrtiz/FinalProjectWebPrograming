1. Understand the Backend API
Since the backend is predefined and cannot be modified, ensure you understand its API endpoints, methods, and data format. For example:
GET /books: Fetch all books.
GET /books/:id: Fetch a specific book's details.
POST /books: Add a new book (for admins).
PUT /books/:id: Update an existing book (for admins).
DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book (for admins).
Also, check if the API requires authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) and where to include them (e.g., headers).

2. Set Up Axios or Fetch
Use Axios (or the Fetch API) for making HTTP requests to the backend.

3. Set Up API Calls
Implement CRUD operations in your app to communicate with the backend:

Fetch all books, Add a book (Admin only), Edit a book (Admin only), Delete a book (Admin only).

4. Integrate with React Components
Use the API calls in your React components.

5. Authentication
If the backend uses JWT authentication:

On login, store the JWT token (e.g., in localStorage).
Include the token in the Authorization header for all requests.

6. Error Handling
Handle API errors gracefully in the UI. For example:
Show a notification or alert when a request fails.
Validate form inputs before making requests.
